# Pytorch-RL-CPP
A Repository with C++ implementations of Reinforcement Learning Algorithms (Pytorch)

**RlCpp is a reinforcement learning framework, written using the [PyTorch C++ frontend](https://pytorch.org/cppdocs/frontend.html).**

RlCpp aims to be an extensible, reasonably optimized, production-ready framework for using reinforcement learning in projects where Python isn't viable. It should be ready to use in desktop applications on 
user's computers with minimal setup required on the user's side.
